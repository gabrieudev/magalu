## Introduction

This project was created as part of a backend challenge proposed in a selection process by the company Magalu, where it is necessary to develop a RESTful API for a communication platform.

## Features

- Scheduling communication delivery.
- Checking the status of a schedule.
- Integration with MySQL database.
- Documentation with Swagger.

## Technologies

- ![Java](https://img.shields.io/badge/Java-17-orange): Programming language.
- ![Spring Boot](https://img.shields.io/badge/Spring%20Boot-3-green): Framework used for building applications.
- ![MySQL](https://img.shields.io/badge/MySQL-Database-blue): Relational database.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to run the project on your machine:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/gabrieudev/magalu.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd <path>`
3. Navigate to the docker directory: `cd docker`
4. Run the docker compose file to create and start the MySQL container: `docker compose up`
5. Go back to the initial directory: `cd <path>`
6. Build the project: `./mvnw clean install` (for Windows: `mvnw.cmd clean install`)
